// EXERCISE: The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids.

fortune = function(){

  var children = 4;
  var partner = "Katharine";
  var location = "Toronto";
  var title = "Web Developer";

  alert("You will be a " + title + " in " + location + ", and married to " + partner + " with " + children + " kids." );
}

fortune();
